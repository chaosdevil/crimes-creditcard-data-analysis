# crimes-creditcard-data-analysis
This is my own implementation and data analysis on 2 types of data : Chicago crimes data and credit card data

Chicago crime data is based on burglary and homicide cases happened in the US.

I use two different main libraries to analyze the data : scikit-learn and pyspark (library for big data)
